## RESTFul Backend Node.js API with React Client

### Overview
- This project involves the development of a backend API using Node.js along with a frontend React client.
- Read the blog about this project on [Medium](https://medium.com/@lexizgichbuoy/building-a-robust-node-js-api-with-react-frontend-a-backend-engineers-journey-0fcbb8f34fa0)

- The API will be plugged to our frontend client, that will speak to the API through HTTP protocol. 

## Technologies Used
* Node.js
* React
* Bootstrap


## Features

### Backend

* Communicate with the backend. HTTP methods and codes.

* Request API endpoints

* Calling the **CRUD**(Create-Read-Update-Delete) endpoints from the client.


* Validate the input data validation with [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) schema validation. (yup schema validator validates input received from body of API)

* [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) package to improve the security of API by setting HTTP response headers.

* Using API documentation generator [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) to add documentation to functions. 


### Frontend

* Styled-components

* Addition of pages using [React-Router-Dom](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)
